# Axelent

![Axelent Sample](axelent-hello.jpg)

A "translation" typeface featuring brutal cuts that transform conventional letterforms into display characters with industrial feel to them.

Works best for display cases, yet somewhat readeable in text as well. Opt in for `optical` instead of `metrics`, when asked 

## Features

- Font with a character, shaped by distinctive cuts
- Creates strong visual impact at larger sizes
- Maintains legibility despite its unconventional forms
